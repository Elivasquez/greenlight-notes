Constants are hoisted to the top of their function scope, or global scope if declared outside of a function.\n\nlet: is the keyword to declare a block scoped variable. Lets can be unassigned, and can be reassigned to any value. Lets are hoisted to the top of the block of code in which they are declared. This means they are scoped to if statements or loops","id":"a71ae2b1-86cc-4d11-8e9e-1ff674edcbbc","date":"2018-02-19T00:20:03.932Z"}
