{"title":"js This clarity","message":"the this keyword acts as a shortcut to refer to an object that is the subject in context or the subject of executing code\n\nUse the this keyword for precision\n\nthe this reference will always refer to and hold the value of an object singular\nUsually used inside a function call or a method\nCan still be used outside the function in the global scope\nIn strict mode this will hold the value of undefined inside the global scope and anonymous functions that aren't bound to an object\nthis is not assigned a value until an object invokes the function where this is defined\nvalue will always be based exclusively off the value of the object that invoked the function\n\nWhen not in strict mode the this keyword will refer to the window object that makes up everything inside the global scope, however as stated before when using strict mode using this in the global scope will return undefined\n\nThe object that invokes the function is the context but the context can be switched by invoking another the this function with another object and then the new object will become the context\n\nWhen a method is passed that uses this as a parameter for a callback function things tend to break\n\nwhen a method is executed on some other object than where the object was originally defined, the this keyword no longer refers to the original object where this was defined, but now it refers to the object that invokes the method where this was defined \nTo avoid this problem use the bind keyword on the original object this was used on\n\nclosures cannot access the outer functions this variable because the this var is only accessible by the function itself, not by the inner functions\n\nwhen an inner function tries to access the outer function's this, the this inside the inner function will be bound to the global window object when  strict is not being used\nTo avoid this problem assign this to a variable to capture the value of this when it refers to the original object context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"c3894790-eb0d-41ba-9db9-99b7e12f18bc","date":"2018-03-15T05:08:19.887Z"}
